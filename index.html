                    <p>There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first time or returning to
                        a
                        favorite one. People of all ages, from all around the world, go to foreign places for different
                        reasons – mainly, for work, family, and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or by automobile,
                        traveling is generally a pleasurable experience, at least for the people who can financially
                        afford
                        comfortable and safe methods of travel. But it has more benefits than satisfying one’s need to
                        make
                        money, like, for example, to see loved ones and enjoy oneself on vacation. There are other
                        benefits
                        of traveling worth mentioning and trying out.
                        Traveling is a humbling experience. It is merely a superior feeling: to go to another country,
                        and to see people live differently, speak differently, look differently. This is how one comes
                        to understand how big and crazy our world is.

                        Another benefit to traveling is coming to see one’s native country in a different light, in a
                        different way. It is possible through making a comparison of your home and a foreign location.
                        Sure, this is impossible without traveling. Going to unknown places create new perspectives and
                        inspiration.
                        This forces them to be adventurous, to live life to the fullest, to make the most of this
                        precious gift and use the time they have to discover new things, and meet new people. This is
                        similar to what people experience when reading a fictional story. They get to become whoever
                        they are reading about, just like when traveling, they get to become the citizens of the country
                        they are visiting, even if it is only for a short time. They live outside their life.

                        To conclude, traveling is the perfect entertainment for a person of any age. On the one hand, it
                        helps people to form a better understanding of themselves, their beliefs, and their lives. On
                        the other, it also provides people with a better understanding of the world they live in, even
                        if it’s beyond their immediate environment. Moreover, it may even help a person to feel
                        connected to the many people living in the world. Nevertheless that their lives may never meet
                        or they are so utterly different that they may as well be from different planets.

                        Perhaps their native country is not as free as they had been told or initially thought it to be,
                        for example. One does not understand what it means to be a citizen of their native country until
                        they have seen it from a distance, from another, completely different country. When traveling
                        elsewhere and having to live according to a foreign place’s laws and social norms, one
                        immediately thinks of how things are done in their own country and culture and begins to favor
                        one way or another. This changes how one feels about their native land, whether in a better or a
                        worse way. This notion can be applied to various characteristics, such as women’s rights, human
                        rights, customs and traditions, beliefs, a trust for government, etc. Traveling is always
                        beneficial for the individual experiencing it.
